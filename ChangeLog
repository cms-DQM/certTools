	* lumi_web.py: 
	- use fixed /ub output in lumiCalc2 (with -o option)
	- fixed beam energy bugs when energy is not "integer"
	- keep track of holes in run ranges, produce the lumicache file 
	for the full range, but use in recorded and delivered only runs in
	COMPLETED mode. A warning is issued in case holes are found so to be
	traced.

	* lumi_web.py: Fixed a problem in getting the correct luminosity
	in overview mode related to a missing string to float conversion
	while parsing nano and microbarn results from the lumicalc script.
	Increased the number of significant digits reported in the output
	2 to 8 to properly handle also the smaller luminosities we have in
	Heavy Ion running conditions.

	* getLumiLoss.py, lumi_web.py, analoss.py, runregparse.py: Initial
	cmmit into CVS repository.
