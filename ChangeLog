	* lumi_web.py: Fixed a problem in getting the correct luminosity
	in overview mode related to a missing string to float conversion
	while parsing nano and microbarn results from the lumicalc script.
	Increased the number of significant digits reported in the output
	2 to 8 to properly handle also the smaller luminosities we have in
	Heavy Ion running conditions.

	* getLumiLoss.py, lumi_web.py, analoss.py, runregparse.py: Initial
